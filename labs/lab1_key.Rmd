```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

Read in the `train.csv` data.

```{r, data}
math <- read_csv(here::here("data", "edld-654-spring-2020", "train.csv")) %>% 
  as_tibble()

```

### 1. Initial Split

Split the data into a training set and a testing set as two named objects. Produce the `class` type for the initial split object and the training and test sets.

```{r, initial_split}
set.seed(3000)

math_split <- initial_split(math) 

math_train <- training(math_split)
math_test  <- testing(math_split)

class(math_split)
class(math_train)
class(math_test)
```

### 2. Use code to show the proportion of the `train.csv` data that went to each of the training and test sets.

```{r}
nrow(math_train)/nrow(math)
nrow(math_test)/nrow(math)
```

### 3. *k*-fold cross-validation

Use 10-fold cross-validation to resample the traning data.

```{r, resample}

set.seed(3000)
cv_folds <- vfold_cv(math_train)
```

### 4. Use `{purrr}` to add the following columns to your *k*-fold CV object:
* *analysis_n* = the *n* of the analysis set for each fold
* *assessment_n* = the *n* of the assessment set for each fold
* *analysis_p* = the proportion of the analysis set for each fold
* *assessment_p* = the proportion of the assessment set for each fold
* *sped_p* = the proportion of students receiving special education services (`sp_ed_fg`) for each fold

```{r}

cv_folds %>% 
  mutate(analysis_n = map_dbl(splits,
                                 ~analysis(.) %>% nrow()), 
         assessment_n = map_dbl(splits,
                                 ~assessment(.) %>% nrow()),
         analysis_p = analysis_n/(analysis_n + assessment_n),
         assessment_p = assessment_n/(analysis_n + assessment_n),
         extended_p = map_dbl(splits,
                               ~sum(.$data$sp_ed_fg == "Y", na.rm = TRUE)/nrow(.$data)))
```

### 5. Please demonstrate that that there are **no** common values in the `id` column between `Fold01` & `Fold02`, and `Fold09` & `Fold10` in your 10-fold cross-validation object.

```{r}

length(
  intersect(
    cv_folds$splits[[1]] %>% 
      assessment() %>% 
      select(id) %>% 
      pull(), 
    cv_folds$splits[[2]] %>% 
      assessment() %>% 
      select(id) %>% 
      pull()
  )
)


length(
  intersect(
    cv_folds %>% 
      pluck("splits", 9) %>%
      assessment() %>%
      select(id) %>%
      pull(),
    cv_folds %>%
      pluck("splits", 10) %>%
      assessment() %>% 
      select(id) %>% 
      pull()
  )
)

```

### 6. Try to answer these next questions without running similar code on real data.

For the following code `vfold_cv(fictional_train, v = 20)`:

* What is the proportion in the analysis set for each fold?

<!-- .95 -->
* What is the proportion in the assessment set for each fold?

<!-- .05 -->

### 7. Use Monte Carlo CV to resample the training data with 20 resamples and .30 of each resample reserved for the assessment sets.

```{r}
set.seed(3000)
mc_folds <- mc_cv(math_train, prop = .70, times = 20)

```

### 8. Please demonstrate that that there **are** common values in the `id` column between `Resample 8` & `Resample 12`, and `Resample 2` & `Resample 20`in your MC CV object.

```{r}

length(
  intersect(
    mc_folds$splits[[8]] %>% 
              assessment() %>% 
              select(id) %>% 
              pull(), 
            mc_folds$splits[[12]] %>% 
              assessment() %>% 
              select(id) %>% 
              pull()
  )
)

length(
  intersect(
    mc_folds %>% 
      pluck("splits", 2) %>%
      assessment() %>%
      select(id) %>%
      pull(),
    mc_folds %>%
      pluck("splits", 20) %>%
      assessment() %>% 
      select(id) %>% 
      pull()
  )
)
```

### 9. You plan on doing bootstrap resampling with a training set with *n* = 500.

* What is the sample size of an analysis set for a given bootstrap resample?

<!-- *n* = 500 -->
* What is the sample size of an assessment set for a given bootstrap resample?

<!-- Will vary by boostrap resample. -->
* If each row was selected only once for an analysis set:
  + what would be the size of the analysis set?
  
  <!-- *n* = 500 -->
  + and what would be the size of the assessment set?
  
  <!-- *n* = 0 -->
