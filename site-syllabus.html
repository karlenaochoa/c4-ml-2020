<h1>Course Overview</h1>
<p>This is the fourth course in a sequence of courses on educational data science (EDS), taught using free and open-source statistical programming languages. This course focuses on applied machine learning (ML), with an emphasis on supervised learning methods that have emerged over the last several decades. The primary goal of these methods is to create models capable of making accurate predictions, which generally implies less emphasis on statistical inference.</p>
<div id="student-learning-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Student Learning objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course students will be able to * Describe the framework of machine learning (i.e. supervised vs. unsupervised learning) and how it differs from standard inferential statistics. * Discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in supervised learning and apply the concept in making decisions about model selection. * Construct various supervised learning models, including linear regression (for prediction rather than inference), penalized regression (ridge/lasso), various decision tree models (including bagged and boosted trees, and random forests), and k-nearest neighbor models. * Measure and contrast the performance of various models. * Construct models for both classification- and regression-based problems. * Conduct feature engineering, including dimension reduction, to increase model performance (and quantify the degree to which model performance changed).</p>

<h1>Assignments and Grading</h1>
<p>Your final grade will be composed of three components:</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Attendance: 20 points (10%; essentially one point per day)</del></li>
<li>6 labs at 11 or 12 points each (70 points; 35%)</li>
<li>Final Project (130 points; 65%)
<ul>
<li>Preliminary fit 1 (10 points)</li>
<li>Preliminary fit 2 (10 points)</li>
<li>Blog post (110 points)
<ul>
<li>Data description (30 points)</li>
<li>Model fit description (35 points)</li>
<li>Model fits (25 points)</li>
<li>Data visualization (10 points)</li>
<li>Reproducibility (10 points)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Note - up to 5 points extra credit will be awarded to the team providing the most performant model</p>
<div id="attendance-20-points" class="section level2">
<h2><del>Attendance (20 points)</del></h2>
<p><del>A critical component of learning data science includes receiving structured feedback as you problem-solve coding and data issues. Each lab will be introduced and begun in class, so that as a group we can talk through the task at hand. Supporting your classmates is also important, and so attendance during final presentations is mandatory.</del></p>
</div>
<div id="labs-70-points-35" class="section level2">
<h2>Labs (70 points; 35%)</h2>
<p>There are 6 labs during the course. All labs will be scored on a “best honest effort” basis, which generally implies zero or full credit (i.e., the assignment was or was not fully completed). However, labs may require students complete specific portions before moving on to the next sections. If you find yourself stuck and unable to proceed, <strong>please contact the instructor for help rather than submitting incomplete work</strong>. Contacting the instructor is part of the “best honest effort”, and can result in full credit for an assignment even if the work is not fully complete. <strong>If the assignment is not complete, and the student has not contacted the instructor for help or visited office hours, it is likely to result is a partial credit score or a zero</strong>. Labs submitted late will be docked by 30% (3 points).</p>
</div>
<div id="final-project-130-points-65" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Project (130 points; 65%)</h2>
<p>The final project in this class is a group project to develop a predictive model for unseen data, along with a blog post describing your methods, including a description of the data used and the analysis procedure, along with an analysis of model performance and description of why you chose the model you did.</p>
<p>We will be using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">kaggle</a> platform to host a local competition. You will receive a link to our class competition page the first week of class. As a team, you will need to work together to build a predictive model. You may link the data to outside data to help increase the performance of your model (e.g., <a href="https://nces.ed.gov">NCES</a>). You will have access to the training dataset, which you will use to build, tune, and evaluate a predictive model. Once you have settled on a model, you will make predictions on a separate set of data that has all the same features (variables) except the outcome. You will then upload these predictions to kaggle, which will provide you with an estimate of your model accuracy on a portion of the test dataset (but not the full test data). Finally, at the end of the course, each team’s most performant model will be evaluated against the full test data (note that this final test regularly leads to changes in the leader board ranking for real kaggle competitions). The team with the best model will be awarded five points extra credit.</p>
<div id="preliminary-fits-20-points" class="section level3">
<h3>Preliminary fits (20 points)</h3>
<p>At the end of Week 5 and Week 8 each team will be required to submit preliminary predictions. Note, you may submit predictions at any time, but you must submit your first predictions by Week 5, and predictions from a new model by Week 8. A quantitative indicator of prediction accuracy will automatically be provided. Submissions will be scored on an “all or nothing” basis at 10 points each. In other words, if your group provides a set of predictions, you will all receive credit, regardless of the performance of the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="blog-posts-110-points" class="section level3">
<h3>Blog post(s) (110 points)</h3>
<p>The primary means by which you will be evaluated on the final project will be through a blog post, or set of blog posts. It is assumed that all students are comfortable creating blog posts, given the content covered in previous courses (specifically EDLD 652). Share relevant code within the blog post(s) to better describe your approach. The components and scoring of the blog post(s) are as follows:</p>
<div id="description-of-the-data-30-points" class="section level4">
<h4>Description of the data (30 points)</h4>
<p>While all teams will work with the same data, the procedures you use with the data are likely to be different than those used by other teams. Describe core features of the data, any additional data you joined in and why, and basic descriptives. Note that this may be a relevant blog post on its own, or a major section within a single blog post.</p>
<p>The description should be sufficiently clear that the instructor understands all the variables that were included in your modeling, and how the final analytic dataset was constructed, without actually viewing your code. While specific code snippets can be included in this section to add clarity, the reader should not have to rely on this code to understand the data preparation.</p>
<p>Provide a summary of the variables (e.g., how many categorical/continuous variables were included, what were the range of values, etc.), and any feature engineering applied to the data. If missing data are present, discuss how these values were handled, variable transformations, etc. Use this section to explain your data splitting process for model evaluation.</p>
</div>
<div id="description-of-the-models-fit-35-points" class="section level4">
<h4>Description of the models fit (35 points)</h4>
<p>At least three models must be fit to the data. Describe each model fit, why the given model was selected, hyperparameters to be optimized, assumptions of the model, and a high-level (think broad audience) description of what the model is doing and why it is appropriate (even as an initial starting point). Discuss how you will evaluate model performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-fits-25-points" class="section level4">
<h4>Model fits (25 points)</h4>
<p>Describe your model fitting procedure(s) and the results of your model evaluation. Compare and contrast the different fits, including a discussion of model performance. Share code to communicate your procedures, and discuss your final model selection and the evidence that led you to this selection.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-visualization-10-points" class="section level4">
<h4>Data visualization (10 points)</h4>
<p>Include at least two plots (you may include more) to help communicate your findings. The plots may be of initial data explorations, fits of individual models, and/or plots displaying competing model performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="reproducibility-10-points" class="section level4">
<h4>Reproducibility (10 points)</h4>
<p>All code should be housed in a GitHub repository and be fully reproducible. The only exception is if external data were used that are sufficiently large that they cannot be stored in the repository (without utilizing LFS). In that case, please make an empty “data” folder with a README file describing how interested parties can access the data. If possible, include a script that downloads the file and places it in the correct directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="extra-credit-5-points" class="section level4">
<h4>Extra credit (5 points)</h4>
<p>Up to five points extra credit will be awarded to the team providing the most performant model. If there are ties amongst teams, extra credit will be awarded at the discretion of the instructor.</p>

<p>In the event of a campus emergency that disrupts academic activities, course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to change. Information about changes in this course will be communicated as soon as possible by email, and on Canvas. If we are not able to meet face-to-face, students should immediately log onto Canvas and read any announcements and/or access alternative assignments. Students are also encouraged to continue the readings and other assignments as outlined on this syllabus or subsequent syllabi.</p>

<p><del>Students must contact the instructor in case of illness or emergencies that preclude attending class sessions. Messages can be left on the instructor’s voice mail or e-mail at any time of the day or night, prior to class. If no prior arrangements have been made before class time, the absence will be unexcused. Excused absences will involve make-up assignments, with make-up assignment procedures to be discussed in class on the first day.</del></p>
<p>If you are unable to complete an assignment due to a personal and/or family emergency, you should contact your instructor or discussion leader as soon as possible. On a case-by-case basis, the instructor will determine whether the emergency qualifies as an excused absence.</p>

<div id="expected-classroom-behavior" class="section level1">
<h1>Expected Classroom Behavior</h1>

<div id="diversity-equity-and-inclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>It is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value equity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for all students. To do so requires that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals.</li>
<li>promote a culture of respect throughout the University community.</li>
<li>respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.</li>
<li>reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind.</li>
<li>practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others.</li>
<li>promote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is the lifeblood of the university.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, class discussions, projects/activities and assignments will challenge students to think critically about and be sensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity, nationality, documentation status, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic background, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and other cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged to develop or expand their respect and understanding of such differences.</p>
<p>Maintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students feel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences, ideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the responsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or diminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This means that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or otherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that students must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s comments.</p>

<div id="indigenous-recognition-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>Indigenous Recognition Statement</h2>
<p>The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Today, descendants are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon, and they continue to make important contributions in their communities, at UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-pronouns-and-personal-preference" class="section level2">
<h2>Using Pronouns and Personal Preference</h2>
<p>The College of Education is always working to include and engage everyone. One way we can do this is to share our pronouns, or the words we want to be called when people aren’t using our name. Like names, pronouns are an important part of how we identify ourselves. Because we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be hurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender, genderqueer, or non-binary. This practice can assist in promoting respectful communication. As a community, we are all learning together about the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans community on campus. If you would like to ensure clarity around pronouns, please feel free to share any pronouns you would prefer me to use when referring to you to help me be aware of how to address you respectfully. Please visit this university website for more information. <a href="https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns" class="uri">https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns</a></p>

<div id="children-in-class" class="section level2">
<h2>Children in class</h2>
<p>I applaud all of you who go to graduate school with children! I had both of my girls while a doctoral student, and I understand the difficulty in balancing academic, work, and family commitments. I want you to succeed. Here are my policies regarding children in class:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as necessary.</li>
<li>Non-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate arrangements cannot be made. As a parent of two young children, I understand that babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick, and other issues arise that leave parents with few other options.</li>
<li>In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend to your child’s needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates.</li>
<li>All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to class.</li>
</ol>
<p>I understand that sleep deprivation and exhaustion are among the most difficult aspects of parenting young children. The struggle of balancing school, work, childcare, and graduate school is tiring, and I will do my best to accommodate any such issues while maintaining the same high expectations for all students enrolled in the class. <strong><em>Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.</em></strong></p>
</div>
